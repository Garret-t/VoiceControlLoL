# VoiceControlLoL
This was a fun little python project I did for the purpose of seeing if I could play games through voice commands. I geared this one towards LoL, using PocketSphinx recognition, I could barely beat the beginner bot due to the inaccuracy, with google's recognition it was more accurate but slower.
